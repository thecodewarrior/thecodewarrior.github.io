<title>Catwalk texture call to the void</title>

<xmp theme="simplex" style="display:none;">
Hi, I'm here again looking for textures.

I suck at making textures. Thus I need someone else to do it for me. Thus I need to find said person. Thus I need to look for said person. Thus I am looking for said person.

I'll list the textures I need.

### Blocks:
* (texture count needed) (total texture area neededâ€”measured in number of distinct parts likely to be used) Texture description (overlay status)
* (3) (3) ~~IE style steel Catwalk~~ (still need overlays)
* (3) (3) ~~Treated wood Catwalk~~ (still need overlays)
* (3) (6) ~~IE style steel Catwalk Stair~~ (still need overlays)
* (3) (6) ~~Treated wood Catwalk Stair~~ (still need overlays)
* (0) (0) ~~IE style steel Scaffolding~~ (no overlays)

* (4) (7) IE style steel Caged Ladder (+ overlays)
* (4) (7) Treated wood Caged Ladder (+ overlays)
* (2) (2) Treated wood Scaffolding (no overlays)

* (3) (Less dumb speed boost overlay for the existing blocks (Catwalk, Caged Ladder, Catwalk Stair)

### Items:

* (1) Speed boost upgrade - attach to a catwalk to increase the player's speed inside it (some kind of moving sidewalk part?)
* (1) Steel grate retexture (maybe?)
* (1) Ladder grabber - Latches onto ladders so you can hold on without holding shift or while in a GUI (maybe a kind of carabiner thing?)

### The textures themselves:

I prefer 16x textures, as they fit in better with the rest of minecraft.

Catwalks, Catwalk Stairs, and Caged Ladders consist of a base layer and three overlays. The overlays are for the different decorations/upgrades you can apply to them. (Caution tape, Lights, Speed boost)

Here are the four of most of the textures, Base, Caution tape, Lights, and Speed boost. These are overlaid depending on what decorations are applied:

Most of the blocks have a "custom" variant that is designed for pack makers to texture and create recipes for, but by default they act
as an easy way to identify what textures go where.

The Stairs are the only really complicated texture map:

There are three distinct parts that are overlaid for the side. I have three parts so that you can have, say a straight line for 
the handrail and a vertical line for the vertical supports. If I had only used a tweaked face the texture would look, well, tweaked. 
There is one that is just tweaked (red), one where the pixels are vertical (green), and one where the pixels run parallel to the handrail (blue). It may take a bit of looking to understand it.

### The existing textures

These textures are for the existing versions of the blocks

These are the new textures shown above, if you want to use them as a reference.
