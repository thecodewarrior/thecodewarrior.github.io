<title>Catwalk texture call to the void</title>

<xmp theme="simplex" style="display:none;">
Hi, I'm here again looking for textures.

I suck at making textures. Thus I need someone else to do it for me. Thus I need to find said person. Thus I need to look for said person. Thus I am looking for said person.

I have a couple disclaimers. First is that I'm not great at dealing with people, second is that I haven't ever worked with an artist before, third is that I'm bad at giving direction as to what I want in a texture.

I'll list the textures I need.

### Blocks:

* IE style Catwalk
* Treated wood Catwalk
* IE style Catwalk Stair
* Treated wood Catwalk Stair
* IE style Caged Ladder
* Treated wood Caged Ladder
* IE style Scaffolding
* Treated wood Scaffolding

* Less dumb speed boost overlay for the existing blocks

### Items:

* Speed boost upgrade - increases the player's speed in a catwalk
* Steel grate retexture (maybe?)
* Ladder grabber - Latches onto ladders so you can hold on without holding shift or while in a GUI

### The textures themselves:

I prefer 16x textures, as they fit in better with the rest of minecraft.

Catwalks, Catwalk Stairs, and Caged Ladders consist of a base layer and three overlays. The overlays are for the different decorations/upgrades you can apply to them. (Caution tape, Lights, Speed boost)

Here are the four of most of the textures, Base, Caution tape, Lights, and Speed boost. These are overlaid depending on what decorations are applied:

The Stairs are the only really complicated texture map:

There are three distinct parts of the side. One that is just tweaked (red), one where the pixels are vertical (green), and one where the pixels run parallel to the handrail (blue). It may take a bit of looking to understand it.

### The existing textures

These textures are for the existing versions of the blocks
